Wordpress Sample Code for Creating a Task and Get Task Details

We have included three types of functions in the documentation which are as follows -

1) Create a Task - (pick up, delivery, pick up and delivery, appointment task)<br>
2) Get Task Details<br>
3) Deleting a Task<br>

Coming soon -
4) Editing a task

Add this folder to your wordpress plugin folder. Once the plugin loads, you will need to add the
API_KEY and your user_id in the pluing for the function calls to connect to your Tookan Account.

API_KEY - this is available in the API Key section in the Dashboard (https://app.tookanapp.com/#/app/settings/apikey)
User_ID - this is available in the Account Settings page.

We have also included a samples.php file to show examples on how to integration Tookan into wordpress and build your own UI over it.
